    <h1>A basic demo of Web Workers</h1>
    
    <p>
        This is basic demo of using Web Workers (which are child threads) to generate a random value which is posted back to
        the main thread (this page). The value is then used to update the Gauge. To make a useful example you could use the
        child thread in conjunction with Web Sockets to retieve (for example) load values from your server(s).
        Also, to retrieve data from your server you may find it easier and less involved to use AJAX.
