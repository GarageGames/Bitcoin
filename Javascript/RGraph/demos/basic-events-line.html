        $(document).ready(function ()
        {
            /**
            * This is the function for the mousemove event. It changes the pointer to the hand.
            * When the mouse is moved away from the point the pointer is changed back to what it was
            * automatically for you.

            function myMousemove (e, point)
            {
                e.target.style.cursor = 'pointer';
            }


            /**
            * This is the function for the click event.
            * 
            * @param object e     The event object
            * @param array  point The details of the point that was clicked
            */
            function myClick (e, point)
            {
                alert('A point was clicked');
            }


            var bar = new RGraph.Line('cvs', [12,13,16,15,16,19,19,12,23,16,13,24])
                .set('events.mousemove', myMousemove)
                .set('events.click', myClick)
                .set('labels', ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'])
                .draw();
        })
    </script>
    
    <p>
        This is a basic example of the Line chart that shows you how to use the pseudo-events that RGraph has:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>events.click</li>
        <li>events.mousemove</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Here the mousemove event is used to change the mouse cursor (it's automatically changed back for you). And the click event
        is used to show an alert.
    </p>
